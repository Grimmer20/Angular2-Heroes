In conjunction with Code School's learnig Angular2, I am building the Angular2 Heroes application.

I find great value in typing all of the code by hand and not copy and pasting from the source. This helps build repition memory, and naturally creating the space for me to ask what each line is doing and explain back to myself.


Getting Started:

Clone the repository onto your local machine

1. Navigate to the desired directory.
2. In terminal type: git clone https://github.com/Grimmer20/Angular2-Heroes.git
3. In terminal type cd 'your_desired_directory_name'
4. In termianl type npm install
5. In termianl type npm start
